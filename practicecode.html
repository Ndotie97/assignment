    <h1>What Lies Beyond Earth</h1>
    <p>Earth formed around 4.54 billion years ago, approximately one-third the age of the universe, by accretion from the solar nebula.
     Volcanic outgassing probably created the primordial atmosphere and then the ocean, 
     but the early atmosphere contained almost no oxygen.

    <h2> Journey Through Our Solar System</h2>
    <p>As each planet in our solar system rotates on its axis, it also revolves around the sun. 
     The time that it takes for a planet to make a complete revolution around the sun is the planet's year. 
     The path that the planet follows around the sun is called its orbit.</p>
